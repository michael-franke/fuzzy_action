# fuzzy_action

The name of this repo is inspired by Johan van Benthem's "Logic in Action". Here we see fuzzy logic (or some derivative) in pragmatic action: pragmatic language use based on fuzzy semantics (or something like that).

Repo contains:

- psiturk code for two pilot experiments
- modeling code to generate predictions about use of expressions like "neither tall nor not tall"

The main modeling action takes place in `model_code/main.r`.
