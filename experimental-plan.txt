3 experiments, each with 5 scenarios, in two parts.
	Scenarios:
	    US male: tall vs short
	    bath: hot vs cold
	    movie: long vs short
	    laptop: expensive vs cheap
	    car: fast vs slow
	Descriptions:
	    “Q”,
	    “not-P”,
	    “neither Q nor not-P”,
	    “neither P nor Q”,
	    “neither P nor not-Q”,
	    “not-Q”,
	    “P”
	    “P and not-P”
    	“Q and not-Q”

Part (a): present scenario, do prior elicitation using a modified Manski method.
	-Use proportions instead of numerical probability estimates.
	-'Think of adult men in the United States. What proportion of them are less than 5 feet 6 inches tall?' etc.

Part (b): get judgments for each description. 
				(or just a subset?)
			Task varies by experiment:

	Experiment 1: give message and degree; ask for acceptability rating or TV judgment
		Use prior elicitation to select degrees for by-subject analysis
		Hypotheses: task indexes 
				-truth-value (vagueness mavens)
				-production prob. (Franke)

	Experiment 2: give degree, ask to choose a description from the list.
		Use prior elicitation to select degrees for by-subject analysis
		Can use either forced-choice, or slider rating for each description.
		Hypothesis: task indexes production prob.

	Experiment 3: give message, ask to choose a degree using slider. 
		Replication/refinement of our first pilot.
		Use prior elicitation to choose min and max values for slider.
		Hypothesis: task indexes interpretation prob.
